# ZERO (ML/DL toolbox)
This project focuses on creating a custom library to streamline common ML/DL pipelines, with plans to release both a developer-focused toolbox and an app for remote model training. The library is named "ZERO" to highlight its goal of being accessible to anyone interested in ML/DL, even those with zero experience in AI.
